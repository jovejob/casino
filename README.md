## Project Setup

First we will test to make sure the app is working. We're going to be using `yarn` for this example, but you could just as easily use NPM if you choose.

```
yarn install

yarn dev
```

You should see the demo app available on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Also recommended to run

```
yarn build
```

To ensure you can successfully do a production build of the project. It's recommended (but not required) to close your dev server when running a Next.js build. Most of the time there is no issue but occasionally the build can put your dev server in a weird state that requires a restart.

You should get a nice little report on the command line of all the pages built with green coloured text implying they are small and efficient. We'll try to keep them that way as we develop the project.

## Engine Locking

We would like for all developers working on this project to use the same Node engine and package manager we are using. To do that we create two new files:

- `.nvmrc` - Will tell other uses of the project which version of Node is used
- `.npmrc` - Will tell other users of the project which package manager is used

We are using `Node v14 Fermium` and `yarn` for this project so we set those values like so:

`.nvmrc`

```.nvmrc
lts/fermium
```

`.npmrc`

```
engine-strict=true
```

The reason we are using v14 instead of v16 for Node is that later in the tutorial we will be deploying on Vercel which unfortunately still does not support Node 16. Perhaps by the time you read this tutorial it might. You can follow the progress [here](https://github.com/vercel/community/discussions/37).

You can check your version of Node with `node --version` and make sure you are setting the correct one. A list of Node version codenames can be found [here](https://github.com/nodejs/Release/blob/main/CODENAMES.md)

Note that the use of `engine-strict` didn't specifically say anything about `yarn`, we do that in `package.json`:

`package.json`

```json
  "name": "nextjs-fullstack-app-template",
  "author": "YOUR_NAME",
  "description": "Next.js application",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "license" : "MIT"
  "homepage": "YOUR_GIT_REPO_URL"
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=14.0.0",
    "yarn": ">=1.22.0",
    "npm": "please-use-yarn"
  },
  ...
```

The `engines` field is where you specify the specific versions of the tools you are using. You can also fill in your personal details if you choose.

## Git Setup

```
git add .

git commit -m 'your new code'
```

Consistency is everything!

## Code Formatting and Quality Tools

In order to set a standard that will be used by all contributors to the project to keep the code style consistent and basic best practices followed we will be implementing two tools:

- [eslint](https://eslint.org/) - For best practices on coding standards
- [prettier](https://prettier.io/) - For automatic formatting of code files

### ESLint

We'll begin with ESLint, which is easy because it automatically comes installed and pre-configured with Next.js projects.

We are just going to add a little bit of extra configuration and make it a bit stricter than it is by default. If you disagree with any of the rules it sets, no need to worry, it's very easy to disable any of them manually. We configure everything in `.eslintrc.json` which should already exist in your root directory:

`.eslintrc.json`

```json
{
  "extends": ["next", "next/core-web-vitals", "eslint:recommended"],
  "globals": {
    "React": "readonly"
  },
  "rules": {
    "no-unused-vars": [1, { "args": "after-used", "argsIgnorePattern": "^_" }]
  }
}
```

You can test out your config by running:

```
yarn lint
```

You should get a message like:

```
âœ” No ESLint warnings or errors
Done in 1.47s.
```

If you get any errors then ESLint is quite good at explaining clearly what they are. If you encounter a rule you don't like you can disable it in "rules" by simply setting it to 1 (warning) or 0 (ignore) like so:

```json
  "rules": {
    "no-unused-vars": 0, // As example: Will never bug you about unused variables again
  }
```

### Prettier

Prettier will take care of automatically formatting our files for us. Let's add it to the project now.

It's only needed during development, so I'll add it as a `devDependency` with `-D`

I also recommend you get the [Prettier VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) so that VS Code can handle the formatting of the files for you and you don't need to rely on the command line tool. Having it installed and configured in your project means that VSCode will use your project's settings, so it's still necessary to add it here.

I created two files in the root:

`.prettierrc`

```.prettierrc
{
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": true
}
```

Those values are entirely at your discretion as to what is best for your team and project.

`.prettierignore`

```
.yarn
.next
dist
node_modules
```

In that file I've placed a list of directories that I don't want Prettier to waste any resources working on. You can also use patterns like \*.html to ignore groups of types of files if you choose.

This is the script to `package.json` so we can run Prettier:

`package.json`

```
  ...
  "scripts: {
    ...
    "prettier": "prettier --write ."
  }
```

You can now run

```
yarn prettier
```

To automatically format, fix and save all files in your project you haven't ignored.

## Git Hooks

One more section on configuration before we start getting into component development. Remember you're going to want this project to be as rock solid as possible if you're going to be building on it in the long term, particularly with a team of other developers. It's worth the time to get it right at the start.

We implemented a tool called [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)

Husky is a tool for running scripts at different stages of the git process, for example add, commit, push, etc. We would like to be able to set certain conditions, and only allow things like commit and push to succeed if our code meets those conditions, presuming that it indicates our project is of acceptable quality.

The second command will create a `.husky` directory in your project. This is where your hooks will live. Make sure this directory is included in your code repo as it's intended for other developers as well, not just yourself.

We have this script in our `package.json` file:

`package.json`

```
  ...
  "scripts: {
    ...
    "prepare": "husky install"
  }
```

This will ensure Husky gets installed automatically when other developers run the project.

To create a hook run

```
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "yarn lint"
```

## The above says that in order for our commit to succeed, the `yarn lint` script must first run and succeed. "Succeed" in this context means no errors. It will allow you to have warnings (remember in the ESLint config a setting of 1 is a warning and 2 is an error in case you want to adjust settings).

Lastly we are going to add one more tool. We have been following a standard convention for all our commit messages so far, let's ensure that everyone on the team is following them as well (including ourselves!). We added a linter for our commit messages:

```
yarn add -D @commitlint/config-conventional @commitlint/cli
```

To configure it we will be using a set of standard defaults, but I like to include that list explicitly in a `commitlint.config.js` file since I sometimes forget what prefixes are available:

`commitlint.config.js`

```js
// build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
// ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
// docs: Documentation only changes
// feat: A new feature
// fix: A bug fix
// perf: A code change that improves performance
// refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
// style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
// test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

module.exports = {
  extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'],
  rules: {
    'body-leading-blank': [1, 'always'],
    'body-max-line-length': [2, 'always', 100],
    'footer-leading-blank': [1, 'always'],
    'footer-max-line-length': [2, 'always', 100],
    'header-max-length': [2, 'always', 100],
    'scope-case': [2, 'always', 'lower-case'],
    'subject-case': [
      2,
      'never',
      ['sentence-case', 'start-case', 'pascal-case', 'upper-case'],
    ],
    'subject-empty': [2, 'never'],
    'subject-full-stop': [2, 'never', '.'],
    'type-case': [2, 'always', 'lower-case'],
    'type-empty': [2, 'never'],
    'type-enum': [
      2,
      'always',
      [
        'build',
        'chore',
        'ci',
        'docs',
        'feat',
        'fix',
        'perf',
        'refactor',
        'revert',
        'style',
        'test',
        'translation',
        'security',
        'changeset',
      ],
    ],
  },
};
```

## VS Code Configuration

We have implemented ESLint and Prettier we can take advantage of some convenient VS Code functionality to have them be run automatically.

Within `settings.json` we will add the following values:

`.vscode/settings.json`

```json
{
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll": true,
    "source.organizeImports": true
  }
}
```

The above will tell VS Code to use your Prettier extension as the default formatter (you can override manually if you wish with another one) and to automatically format your files and organize your import statements every time you save.

Very handy stuff and just another thing you no longer need to think about so you can focus on the important things like solving business problems.

## Debugging

Let's set up a convenient environment for debugging our application in case we run into any issues during development.

Inside of your `.vscode` directory create a `launch.json` file:

`launch.json`

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Next.js: debug server-side",
      "type": "node-terminal",
      "request": "launch",
      "command": "npm run dev"
    },
    {
      "name": "Next.js: debug client-side",
      "type": "pwa-chrome",
      "request": "launch",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000"
    },
    {
      "name": "Next.js: debug full stack",
      "type": "node-terminal",
      "request": "launch",
      "command": "npm run dev",
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "serverReadyAction": {
        "pattern": "started server on .+, url: (https?://.+)",
        "uriFormat": "%s",
        "action": "debugWithChrome"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

With that script in place you have three choices for debugging. CLick the little "bug & play icon" on the left of VS Code or press `Ctrl + Shift + D` to access the debugging menu. You can select which script you want to run and start/stop it with the start/stop buttons.

## Directory Structure

This section is now going to cover setting up the folder structure in our project. This is one of those topics that many people will have _extremely strong opinions about_, and for good reason! Directory structure can really make or break a project in the long term when it gets out of control, especially when fellow team members have to spend unnecessary time trying to guess where to put things (or find things).

I personally like to take a fairly simplistic approach, keep things separated basically in a class model/view style. We will be using three primary folders:

```
/components
/lib
/pages
```

- `component` - The individual UI components that make up the app will live in here
- `lib` - Business/app/domain logic will live in here.
- `pages` - Will be the actual routes/pages as per the required Next.js structure.

We will have other folders in addition to this to support the project, but the core of almost everything that makes up the unique app that we are building will be housed in these three directories.

Within `components` we will have subdirectories that kind of group similar types of components together. You can use any method you prefer to do this. I have used the MUI library quite a bit in my time, so I tend to follow the same organization they use for components in [their documentation](https://mui.com/getting-started/installation/)

For example inputs, surfaces, navigation, utils, layout etc.

You don't need to create these directories in advance and leave them empty. I would just create them as you go while building your components.

## Adding Storybook

One of the great modern tools available to us if you aren't already familiar with it is called [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

Storybook gives us an environment to show off and test the React components we are building outside of the application we are using them in. It's great tool to connect developers with designers and be able to verify components we have developed look and function as per design requirements in an isolated environment without the overhead of the rest of the app.

Note that Storybook is meant as a visual testing tool, we will be implementing other tools later for functional unit testing and end-to-end testing.

The best way to learn how to use Storybook is installing it and trying it out!

We'll be using the webpack5 version to stay up to date with the latest version of webpack (I'm unsure why it is still not yet the default. Maybe it will be by the time you are using this tutorial).

When Storybook installs it automatically detects a lot of things about your project, like how it is a React app, and other tools you are using. It should take care fo all that configuration itself.

If you get a prompt about the eslintPlugin, you can say "yes". We are going to configure it manually though, so no worries if you get a message saying it didn't auto-configure.

Open up `.eslintrc.json`:

`.eslintrc.json`

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "plugin:storybook/recommended", // New
    "next",
    "next/core-web-vitals",
    "eslint:recommended"
  ],
  "globals": {
    "React": "readonly"
  },
  // New
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": ["*.stories.@(ts|tsx|js|jsx|mjs|cjs)"],
      "rules": {
        // example of overriding a rule
        "storybook/hierarchy-separator": "error"
      }
    }
  ],
  "rules": {
    "no-unused-vars": [1, { "args": "after-used", "argsIgnorePattern": "^_" }]
  }
}
```
